# How to Host an Online Resume (and learn some fundamentals of Tech Comm along the way)
This README will describe how to host a great-looking resume on GitHubPages. It's free, btw. And while showing you this rather simple task, this README will relate the steps required to host a resume to the steps describedin Andrew Etter's popular book _Modern Technical Writing_. In brief, you'll get a resume to land you an interview and in the interview you can sound like a pro when it comes to code documentation or other technical communication projects in CS. 

## Audience
This README is intended for a juniour CS crowd. Basically, I'm writing it for other CS students. We're in this together. (And I do mean that--see how GitHub lets you edit each other's work?)
