# How to Host an Online Resume (and learn some fundamentals of Tech Comm along the way)
This README will describe how to host a great-looking resume on GitHubPages. It's free, btw. And while showing you this rather simple task, this README will relate the steps required to host a resume to the concepts of Andrew Etter's popular book _Modern Technical Writing_. In brief, you'll get the skills to 1) host a great-looking free resume; and 2) learn enough about documentation that you can sound like a pro in the interviews you get from your resume.  

## Audience
This README is intended for a juniour CS crowd. Basically, I'm writing it for other CS students. We're in this together.
